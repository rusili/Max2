 *
 * The goal of this exercise is to run a functional application that is architected well. It should show a list of {@link Person} items,
 * and based on user input, modifying the item. After completing, show the result on the emulator.
 * Feel free to consult web sites/ personal projects etc.
 *
 * Part I. Show a list of people and details.
 * - Show name, a heart icon, and an avatar image as a list on as part of the MainActivity.
 * - When clicking on an item, all information is displayed on DetailActivity with the ability favorite an item
 * - In addition, create a "Favorite" button on the detail page - this should change the drawable image from one to the other on the main list.
 *
 * - There are screen shots for how the layouts are supposed to look in the root directory.
 *
 *
 * Part II. show a list of items as a GET API Request to server using any kind of framework you know.
 * - Discuss how you would display and use the information retrieved from the below endpoint
 *      http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
 * - Discuss how to handle network errors
 * - Discuss how to model the object
 *
 *
 * WE PREFER FUNCTIONALITY FIRST, LAYOUT LAST
 *
 * <p/>

 *  adding any test cases, frameworks, and code relevant
 *  using MVP structure.
